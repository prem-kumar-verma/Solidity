## Introduction

Solidity is a high-level, statically-typed programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Solidity runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and is influenced by JavaScript, Python, and C++.
