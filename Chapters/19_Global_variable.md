# Global Variables in Solidity

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
Global variables in Solidity are special variables that provide information about the blockchain, transactions, and contracts. These variables are accessible anywhere within the smart contract and help interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

## ðŸ”¥ **Most Useful Global Variables in Solidity**

### âœ… **1. `msg.sender`**
- Represents the address of the account that called the function.
- Commonly used for authentication and access control.

### âœ… **2. `msg.value`**
- Represents the amount of Ether (in wei) sent with a transaction.
- Used in payable functions.

### âœ… **3. `block.timestamp`**
- Returns the timestamp of the current block (Unix time).
- Useful for time-based logic in smart contracts.

### âœ… **4. `block.number`**
- Returns the current block number.
- Can be used to measure time intervals based on blocks.

### âœ… **5. `tx.gasprice`**
- Returns the gas price of the transaction.
- Useful for estimating transaction costs.

### âœ… **6. `tx.origin`**
- Returns the original sender of the transaction.
- Not recommended for access control due to security risks.

### âœ… **7. `gasleft()`**
- Returns the remaining gas in the transaction.
- Can be used for gas optimizations.

### âœ… **8. `address(this)`**
- Refers to the contractâ€™s own address.
- Useful for sending and receiving Ether within the contract.

### âœ… **9. `msg.data`**
- Returns the complete calldata (input data) of the transaction.
- Useful for working with raw transaction data.

### âœ… **10. `blockhash(uint blockNumber)`**
- Returns the hash of a given block.
- Only works for the last 256 blocks.

## âœ… **Example Code Demonstrating Global Variables**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract GlobalVariablesExample {
    address public owner;
    uint public lastBlock;
    uint public lastBlockTimestamp;
    uint public receivedAmount;
    address public sender;
    
    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender; // Stores the contract deployerâ€™s address
    }

    function receiveEther() public payable {
        receivedAmount = msg.value; // Stores the amount of Ether received
        sender = msg.sender; // Stores senderâ€™s address
        lastBlock = block.number; // Stores the latest block number
        lastBlockTimestamp = block.timestamp; // Stores the block timestamp
    }

    function getContractAddress() public view returns (address) {
        return address(this); // Returns the contract's address
    }
}
```

### ðŸ”¹ **Explanation of the Code**
1. **`msg.sender`**: Stores the senderâ€™s address in `sender`.
2. **`msg.value`**: Stores the amount of Ether received in `receivedAmount`.
3. **`block.number`**: Stores the latest block number in `lastBlock`.
4. **`block.timestamp`**: Stores the blockâ€™s timestamp in `lastBlockTimestamp`.
5. **`address(this)`**: Returns the contractâ€™s own address.

## ðŸ“Œ **Key Takeaways**
1. **Global variables provide crucial blockchain and transaction data**.
2. **`msg.sender` and `msg.value` are essential for handling transactions**.
3. **Block-related variables help track timestamps and block numbers**.
4. **Gas-related variables allow for transaction cost estimation**.
5. **Be cautious with `tx.origin`, as it can lead to security vulnerabilities**.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Conclusion**
Solidityâ€™s global variables are powerful tools that simplify contract development by providing real-time blockchain data. Understanding and utilizing these variables efficiently helps in creating robust and optimized smart contracts.
